# Traxxas_LEDs
## Overview/Info
Under Construction. Project mostly works. Some stuttering in the LED patterns. Still configuring patterns to find ones I like.

I have never written in C before and the core of this took me about 12 hours to write so expect a lot of inefficiencies and some errors.

## Hardware
- LED controller is Teensy 4.0.
- Traxxas 6533 reciever, stock for X-Maxx.
- Traxxas 6530 transmitter, upgrade for X-Maxx. Stock 6528 will NOT work for this, not enough channels.
